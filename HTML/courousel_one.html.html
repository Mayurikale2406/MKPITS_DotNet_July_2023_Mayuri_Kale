        <p style="padding-left: 50px;padding-right: 50px;margin-top: 30px;">You take good care of your skin and your body. You work hard to eat right, exercise, and look your best.

            Great. But how’s your hair looking?If your answer is “not great,” -- or if you don’t even think much about your hair -- you’re making a huge mistake. Think about it: smart grooming doesn’t stop at your hairline! So you need to learn how to take care of your hair properly if you want to stay looking great.
            
            The good news? Hair care for men isn’t as hard as it may seem. Here are 7 essential, easy-to-follow hair care and hair health tips for your men’s hair routine.</p>
        <div class="jambotron text-center">
        <h2 style="margin-top: 10px;">Understanding Hair Care for Men Basics</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Taking care of your hair is simple once you understand the basics and it starts with knowing your hair type. 

            Is your hair oily or dry? Frizzy or flat? 
            
            Once you have identified your hair type, look for products that work best for your hair type. But before using any products, always check out ingredient labels. 
            
            Many products are filled with harsh chemicals that actually damage your hair, so whenever possible, choose products made with natural ingredients like our hair care products. Here are some additional key things to keep in mind before we dive into our essential hair care routine.</p>
        <h2 style="margin-top:10px;"> Scalp</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;"> Taking care of your scalp is a priority for men's hair health. A healthy scalp is vital for lustrous hair. There are three main types of scalp conditions - oily, dry, and normal - and each type requires a different hair care routine. The first step to ensuring you take care of your hair and scalp properly is identifying your scalp type.

        </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top:10px;">Oily Scalp  </h2>
        <p  style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;" >Constant slick and greasy hair (without any product use)? You have an oily scalp. When your scalp produces too much sebum, the oil can build up creating a greasy look. 

            An oily scalp can be caused by various factors including overwashing, hair type (such as straight hair), and reactions to hair care products. To combat oily scalp for men’s healthy hair, avoid overwashing and use products specifically formulated for oily scalp.
           </p>
        <h2 style="margin-top:10px;"> Curly</h2>
        <p style="padding-left: 50px; padding-right: 50px;">Anyone with curly hair knows that it can be a bit of a handful. The key to maintaining healthy curls is to avoid over-washing, use a deep conditioner regularly, and get the right haircut.

            And when it comes to styling products (or any products in general), avoid anything with harsh chemicals - they’ll only damage your hair in the long run. Opt for products made with all natural ingredients like our All-in-One Wash for Men to quickly cleanse your hair, body, and face.  </p>

    <li><h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Use The Right Shampoo  </h4></li>
</ul> 
<ol>   
    <p ><li> The right shampoo for your hair type can be a confusing endeavor. Hydrating, strengthening, smoothing, color-safe, thickening—how do you match the lingo on the bottle with the hair on your head? The thing is, though, that choosing a shampoo that corresponds with your hair type can make all the difference, creating the right balance of moisture, shine, and bounce.</li>
   <li> We tapped board-certified dermatologists Sharleen St. Surin-Lord, Tsippora Shainhouse, and trichologist Shab Reslan to learn how to find the best shampoo for your hair type. Spoiler alert: It all starts with knowing what kind of scalp you have.</li>
  </p>
</ol>
<ul>
    <li><h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Don't shampoo daily</h4></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <p> <li> For most people, it is not necessary to wash their hair everyday. So the decision about how frequently to wash hair depends on a person's hair type, scalp texture, how oily the hair gets, and personal preference. For some people, too-frequent washing can cause damaged hair and a dry, itchy scalp.</li>
        <li>"The average individual can typically go 2 to 3 days without shampooing their hair.</li>
    </p>  
</ol> 
<ul>
    <li><h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Follow up with conditioner </h4></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <p><li>Conditioner is usually the second step to hair washing. While shampoo is formulated specifically to clean off sweat, dead skin cells, and hair products, conditioner makes hair softer and easier to manage. It also protects hair shafts from damage.</li>
       <li>Conditioners have fatty alcohols, humectants, and oils to make hair soft and flexible. Some have protein to temporarily bind split ends, and some have thickening agents to make hair feel fuller.</li>
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Trim Regularly </h4></li>
    </ul>
<ol>
    <p><li>Trimming your hair every 12 to 15 weeks can make it look healthier and thicker</li>
        <li>To get rid of split ends, you must trim your hair at regular intervals</li>
        <li>If you do not wish to cut your hair, look for treatments for damaged locks and split ends</li>
</ol>
</p>
<ul>
    <li><h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Treat Your Hair Gently</h4></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <p>Experts suggest that many people over-shampoo or shampoo incorrectly. The standard rules of thumb are:

       <li> Don’t wash your hair more than once a day.</li>
       <li>Use only enough of the product to cover your hair.</li>
       <li>Avoid using very hot or very cold water.</li>
    </p>
<ul>
        <li><h4 style="margin-top: 10px;">Massage with Hair Oil</h4></li>
</ul>
<ol>
    <p> Keep in mind, when using oil on your scalp, it may be worth testing to be sure you don’t have an allergy. Do a patch test before using oil in your hair for a full treatment.</p>
    <p> Oils used may include:</p>
    <li> coconut</li>
    <li> sesame</li>
    <li> almond</li>
    <li> bhringraj</li>
    <li> amla</li>
</ol>
